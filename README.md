# Fake-News-Detection
Developed a robust system for detecting fake news utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Leveraged NLP to analyze textual content, extracting features and patterns indicative of misinformation. Implemented machine learning models trained on labeled datasets to classify news articles as either genuine or fake based on various factors such as language style, source credibility, and content consistency. Employed techniques such as sentiment analysis and fact-checking to enhance the accuracy of the detection system. Conducted rigorous testing and evaluation to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the fake news detection algorithm.
